# WTF?

This thing draws text letter by letter on each GIF frame.
This code will be used for a telegram bot

# How?

Actually, It uses Cairo under the hood and a lot of complicated things.
But you can use it by passing a string to the `start` npm script

```ts
npm run start -- "your text less than 200 characters"
```

# Why?

For fun
